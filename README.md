# My-Basic-Calculator
This  is   a basic  Calcultor  built  in  JavaScript,  I made It  to  help beginners to master basic  notions  in  JS, feel  free  to  build up  on  It,  make changes, untill you  understand  what  you  are doing.  
PS:  As an  Ethical Hacker/Bug Bounty,  I found  necessary  to  master coding  ,  if  you  need  to  be successful.  otherwwise you  will  be  a scriptkiddie , relying  on  automated  tools...  It's a  must  for you to  master,  at least  the 40% of  each  programming  language.

All  you  need  is  your  text  editor 
Open  the  3 files  js,htm,  css  in  an text  editor.  
read  all  through  the html  file, understand the  structure
then  move to  the css,  understand  the decoration,
finally  jump  to  the Js ,  understand the functions,  line by line,  if  you  don't understand  any  line,  google it.  
Now it's  time  to  make  some changes,  change  the whole  css  display,  according  to  your  feelings
For the Js,  you  can  add some special  functions,  like  adding  other langages  options, adding  alarm  clock  etc.
Never forget  to save at  any  step  you make  a change <ctrl+s>
Never forget this:  the three file need to  be saved  in the same folder
After  all ,  open  the index.html file to  see  how  your  project  look  like .  
GOOD LUCK
